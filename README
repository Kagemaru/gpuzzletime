-----------

small tooling to transfer timelog-entries from gtimelog's timelog.txt to the PuzzleTime TimeTracking Website.

Approach
--------

- [ ] read timelog.txt
  - [ ] from known location
  - [ ] later: configure location?
  - [ ] later: auto-detect location?
- [ ] parse out last day
  - [ ] especially start/end-times for each entry
  - [ ] date - ticket - description
  - [ ] later: parse out specific day
- [ ] open N browser instances with the time entry data
  - [ ] without selected account
- [ ] infer time-account from ticket-format
- [ ] ticket->account mappings from configuration
- [ ] complete login/entry automation
  - [ ] login
  - [ ] store cookie
  - [ ] make entries
  - [ ] open day in browser for review
- [ ] avoid duplicate entries
  - [ ] start/end time as indicator?
